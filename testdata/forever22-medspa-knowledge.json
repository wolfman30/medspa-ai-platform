      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "category": "faq",
      "content": "Q: Is Brandi available right now?\nA: Brandi is often with patients during the day. If she can't take your call, the AI assistant can help you schedule an appointment or answer common questions. Brandi will follow up personally as soon as she's available.\n\nQ: Do I need a consultation first?\nA: Aesthetic consultations are FREE and completely optional. For most treatments, we can discuss your goals during your first appointment. Brandi takes time with each client to ensure you're comfortable and informed.\n\nQ: What makes Forever 22 different?\nA: Brandi Sesock leads a small boutique team that delivers highly personalized care. You'll be seen by Brandi or Gale depending on the service and availability, and every visit is tailored to your goals.\n\nQ: What is the Perfect Derma Peel?\nA: The Perfect Derma Peel is a FAVORITE service and signature treatment at Forever 22! It's a medium depth chemical peel that addresses hyperpigmentation, large pores, fine lines, wrinkles, and acne scars. You'll peel for 3-4 days and have perfect skin in 7 days. It's ideal for any skin type and delivers dramatic results.\n\nQ: Does Botox hurt?\nA: Most clients describe minimal discomfort - like a small pinch. Brandi uses very fine needles and excellent technique. The treatment only takes 10-15 minutes.\n\nQ: When will I see results?\nA: Botox results appear in 3-5 days, with full results at 2 weeks. Fillers show immediate results, though final results appear after swelling subsides (2-7 days). The Perfect Derma Peel shows results in 7 days. Other treatments vary - Brandi will explain expected timelines.\n\nQ: Will I look natural?\nA: Absolutely! Brandi specializes in natural-looking enhancements. You'll look like yourself, just refreshed and rejuvenated. She takes a conservative approach and can always add more if needed.\n\nQ: How many treatments will I need?\nA: This varies by service. Botox lasts 3-4 months. Fillers last 6-18 months. Laser hair removal requires 6-8 sessions. Microneedling works best in a series of 3 treatments, 4 weeks apart. Skin treatments often work best in a series. Brandi will create a personalized plan for your goals.\n\nQ: What is the best treatment for my concern?\nA: Book a FREE aesthetic consultation! Brandi will assess your skin, discuss your goals, and recommend the best treatment plan. There's no obligation - just helpful, expert guidance.\n\nQ: Do you offer weight loss programs?\nA: Yes! We offer medically supervised weight loss programs with prescription injections. Brandi provides nutritional support and ongoing care throughout your journey. Book a consultation (in-person or virtual) to learn more and see if you're a candidate.\n\nQ: What skincare products do you recommend?\nA: Forever 22 offers SkinMedica, a pharmaceutical-grade skincare line with next-generation growth factors and peptides. These medical-grade products deliver results beyond over-the-counter options and help maintain your treatment results at home."
