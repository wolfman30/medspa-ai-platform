      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions - Botox",
      "category": "faq",
      "content": "Q: Does Botox hurt?\nA: Most clients describe it as a small pinch. We use very fine needles and can apply numbing cream if you're sensitive. The entire treatment takes only 10-15 minutes.\n\nQ: When will I see results from Botox?\nA: You'll start seeing results in 3-5 days, with full results visible at 2 weeks. Results typically last 3-4 months.\n\nQ: Will Botox make me look frozen or fake?\nA: Not at all! Our providers are trained in natural-looking results. You'll still have facial expressions, just smoother skin. We can always start conservative and add more at your 2-week follow-up if needed.\n\nQ: What should I avoid after Botox?\nA: Avoid lying down for 4 hours, intense exercise for 24 hours, and rubbing the treated area for 24 hours. You can return to normal activities immediately otherwise.\n\nQ: How much does Botox cost?\nA: Botox is $12 per unit. Most clients need 20-50 units depending on the areas treated. We'll give you an exact quote during your consultation.\n\nQ: Can I get Botox if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?\nA: We recommend waiting until after pregnancy and breastfeeding to be safe, as there are no studies on Botox during this time."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions - Fillers",
      "category": "faq",
      "content": "Q: How long do lip fillers last?\nA: Lip fillers typically last 6-12 months depending on the product used and your metabolism. Juvederm and Restylane are our most popular options.\n\nQ: Will lip filler look natural?\nA: Absolutely! We specialize in natural-looking enhancement. Most clients want a subtle improvement, not an overdone look. We can show you before/after photos and discuss your goals.\n\nQ: Does lip filler hurt?\nA: We use numbing cream and our fillers contain lidocaine for comfort. Most clients say it's less painful than they expected. You may feel pressure but minimal pain.\n\nQ: What's the recovery time for fillers?\nA: Most clients have minor swelling for 2-3 days and possibly some bruising. You can go back to work the same day. We recommend avoiding big events for a week to allow swelling to fully resolve.\n\nQ: Can filler be dissolved if I don't like it?\nA: Yes! Hyaluronic acid fillers (like Juvederm and Restylane) can be dissolved with an enzyme injection if needed. This is rare but gives you peace of mind.\n\nQ: How much filler do I need?\nA: This varies by person and goals. For lips, most clients need 1 syringe for subtle enhancement or 2 for more dramatic results. We'll assess your needs during the consultation."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions - General",
      "category": "faq",
      "content": "Q: Do I need a consultation before booking a treatment?\nA: For most treatments, we can discuss your goals during your first appointment. For complex treatments (like CoolSculpting or Sculptra), we recommend a complimentary consultation first.\n\nQ: Do you offer financing?\nA: Yes! We partner with CareCredit and Cherry for financing options. You can apply online and get approved in minutes. We also offer in-house payment plans for treatments over $1,000.\n\nQ: Are your treatments safe?\nA: Absolutely. All our providers are licensed medical professionals (MD, NP, or RN) with extensive training in aesthetic treatments. We use FDA-approved products and follow strict safety protocols.\n\nQ: How do I prepare for my appointment?\nA: Arrive with a clean face (no makeup for facial treatments). Avoid alcohol and blood thinners (like aspirin or ibuprofen) for 24 hours before injections to minimize bruising. Bring photos of desired results if you have them!\n\nQ: What if I'm not happy with my results?\nA: Your satisfaction is our priority. We offer complimentary follow-up appointments to address any concerns. For injectable treatments, we can add more product or adjust as needed.\n\nQ: Do you see men?\nA: Yes! About 30% of our clients are men. Botox and fillers are increasingly popular for men looking to maintain a youthful, refreshed appearance.\n\nQ: What's your cancellation policy?\nA: Please give us 24 hours notice to cancel or reschedule. New clients have a $50 deposit that is forfeited for late cancellations but applied to your service if you keep your appointment."
