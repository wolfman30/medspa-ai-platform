## 5:00 PM Run — 3 New Prospects

**New prospects researched and added:**

1. **Visage MedSpa** (Willoughby, OH) — Karen Michelson, CNP. Solo NP, 20+ years, national trainer. Only open 4 days/week with limited hours. Direct email found: karen@visagemedspaohio.com. **Strong fit** — guaranteed missed calls as solo provider.

2. **Gemma Wellness Medical Spa** (Bath/Akron, OH) — Dr. Lori L. Gemma, DO. Solo physician doing ALL procedures personally. Voted Top #3 Med Spa in Akron. No email found, will need to reach via contact form or Facebook. **Strong fit** — solo practitioner = constant missed calls.

3. **NEOSkin Medical Spa** (Hudson, OH) — Dr. Tricia N. Bedrick, physician-owner. Premium/luxury positioning, membership model, CareCredit + PatientFi. Uses **Zenoti** EMR (non-Moxie tier). **Moderate fit** — Zenoti has competing AI features but text-back is differentiated.

## 8:00 PM Run — 3 New Prospects (Evening)

**New prospects researched and added:**

1. **KÜR Modern Medical Aesthetics** (Downtown Cleveland) — Nina Pupovac, NP, Founder. Top 100 Best Injectors in America (2021). Luxury positioning, small team (3 people). No phone on website (contact form only). **Score: 7/10** — great fit personality-wise but phone absence reduces text-back urgency. Outreach via contact form or IG.

3. **Cleveland Primecare MedSpa** (Beachwood) — Deidra Bobincheck, NP-C. Hybrid primary care + mental health + medspa. Phone (216) 329-3810. Affluent Beachwood suburb. **Score: 7.5/10** — triple service model means busy phones, small team.
