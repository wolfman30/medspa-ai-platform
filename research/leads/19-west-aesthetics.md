## Analysis
- **Solo practitioner** — Shannon is founder and only listed provider
- **Newer practice** (Squarespace site, still building brand)
- **Uses Aesthetic Record EMR** — not Moxie, but still a good fit for text-back
- **No phone number prominently displayed** — relies on online booking
- **Dayton market** — less saturated than Cleveland/Columbus
- **Weight loss services** = expanding revenue streams
- **Estimated revenue:** $150K-$300K/year (solo practitioner, newer practice)
- **Fit assessment:** Good prospect but lower urgency — no prominent phone means fewer missed calls. Best angle: capture leads from Instagram DMs and website visitors who don't book.
