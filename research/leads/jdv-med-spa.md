## Notes
- Well-established, highly successful independent med spa
- Two locations but still locally owned (not a chain)
- All-RN staff model — high volume, likely busy phones
- Award-winning = strong reputation = likely high call volume
- Perfect candidate: busy practice, injectables-focused, independent
- Being #1 in Galderma sales means VERY high patient volume → lots of missed calls
