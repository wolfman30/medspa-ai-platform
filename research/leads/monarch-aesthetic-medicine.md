## Outreach Angle
Woman-owned, 24-year legacy practice with stellar reviews. Heather took ownership in 2022 — she's a newer owner who may be looking to grow and modernize. Personal touch: mention her OSU background (Andrew's in Ohio too). Their M-F schedule means weekend calls go unanswered. High-end positioning ($$ on Yelp) = high-value leads being lost.
