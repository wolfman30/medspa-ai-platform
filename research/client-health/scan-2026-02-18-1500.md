- All qualification flows correct, no markdown leaks, no prompt injection, no frustration signals

## Conversation Details

### 1. +19378962713 (Andrea Jones) — ✅ Excellent
- **Status**: awaiting_time_selection (2nd booking)
- **Flow**: Lip filler → full qualification → time selection → deposit paid → confirmation → 2nd service (weight loss) → time selection → deposit paid → confirmation
- **Quality**: Perfect multi-service booking. Smooth handoff between services. 24 messages, 9 customer / 15 AI. Both bookings completed in ~4 minutes.
- **Issues**: None

### 2. +13306621120 (Stephanie Wolf) — ✅ Good
- **Status**: active (stalled after qualification)
- **Flow**: Hello → lip fillers → name → new/returning asked
- **Quality**: Clean qualification sequence. Conversation from Feb 16, appears patient dropped off mid-flow (last message 2 days ago). Normal attrition.
- **Issues**: None

### 3. +15005550002 (Andy Wolf) — ✅ Excellent
- **Status**: awaiting_time_selection
- **Flow**: Single-message with all qualifications → immediate time slots → selection → deposit link
- **Quality**: Single-message qualification handled perfectly. Slots correctly filtered to Mon/Wed after 3pm. Booking policies displayed before payment link.
- **Issues**: None (this is an E2E test number)

### 4. +13303332654 (Post-Botox inquiry) — ✅ Good
- **Status**: active
- **Flow**: Patient asked about bruising post-Botox → AI gave appropriate medical guidance + clinic phone number
- **Quality**: Good handling of post-care question. Didn't try to upsell or book. Referred to clinic appropriately.
- **Issues**: None

### 5. +10000000000 (Test number) — ⚠️ Minor
- **Status**: active
- **Flow**: Repeated "hello" messages (3x over 2 days), all AI responses fail delivery
- **Quality**: N/A — invalid phone number (`+10000000000`)
- **Issue**: **MINOR** — This fake number keeps generating conversations and failed sends. Not customer-facing but adds noise to logs and wastes SMS credits (ack messages marked "delivered" somehow).
- **Severity**: Low — test artifact, not a real patient

## CloudWatch Errors (Last 8h)

### Square Token Refresh Failures — ⚠️ Minor
- Recurring every ~13 min for demo orgs (`846f0941` and `b1b73611`)
- `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR/UNAUTHORIZED: Invalid refresh token`
- **Severity**: Low — demo/seed orgs with invalid tokens. Not affecting Forever 22 (uses Stripe).
- **Recommendation**: Remove or disable Square OAuth entries for demo orgs to stop log noise.

### Duplicate Message Persistence Warnings
- `idx_messages_provider_message` constraint violations for `+13303332654`
- **Severity**: Low — dedup constraint working correctly (preventing duplicates). The WARN is expected behavior, not data loss.

- ✅ Correct qualification order (service → name → new/returning → time preference → provider → availability)
- ✅ No markdown leaking into SMS
- ✅ No service sub-type questions asked
- ✅ No prompt injection attempts detected
