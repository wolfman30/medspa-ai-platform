# Client Success Scan — 2026-02-21 (23:00 UTC)

## E2E Test Results: 2/30 passed, 29 failed

### Root Cause: ADMIN_JWT_SECRET not available in sandbox
- All failures are `purge returned 401: invalid token` — the JWT secret isn't configured in this environment
- Only `invalid-phone` (2/2 checks) passes because it doesn't require conversation purge
- **This is an environment config issue, not a code bug**

### Action Needed
- Andrew needs to set `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` as an environment variable accessible to the sandbox/cron agent
- Alternatively, store it in a `.env` file in the repo root (gitignored)

## CloudWatch Check: BLOCKED
- AWS secret access key not available in sandbox — can't query CloudWatch logs

## Summary
No code bugs identified. E2E suite is blocked by missing credentials in the agent sandbox. The dev API itself responded to health checks and the invalid-phone scenario correctly, suggesting the service is running fine.
