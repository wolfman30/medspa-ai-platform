Hi there,

I came across The Luxe MedSpa while researching aesthetics practices in Upper Arlington — love that you're combining injectables with wellness services like TRT. That's a smart play for the Columbus market.

Here's something I've been thinking about: when a prospective patient calls about Botox or Sculptra and nobody picks up, what happens? Most people don't leave voicemails anymore — they just call the next med spa on Google.

We built a simple AI tool that catches those missed calls instantly. Within seconds, the patient gets a text that qualifies them (what service, when they're available, any preferences) and gets them booked — no human needed.

It's $497/month and typically pays for itself with 1-2 recovered appointments. We're offering free setup for our first 10 Ohio clinics.

Worth a quick call? I can demo it live in under 10 minutes.

Best,
