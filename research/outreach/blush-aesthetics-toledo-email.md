Hi Erin,

I came across Blush Aesthetics while researching the best med spas in Ohio — and your background stood out. Organizing clinical trials and training providers nationally? That's a level of commitment most clinic owners don't have.

But here's the thing I keep wondering: when you're at a conference or mid-treatment, what happens to the calls? Because in aesthetics, 62% of missed calls never call back — they just book with whoever answers first.

We built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas like Blush. When someone calls and you can't pick up, they get a personalized text within seconds — starting a conversation about what they're looking for, checking availability, and even collecting a deposit. No robotic phone trees. No generic voicemail.

A few things that might resonate with your practice:
- **Wedding season surge** — brides calling after hours for last-minute appointments
- **Single-location practice** — every missed call hits harder when there's no overflow
- **Your reputation** — 5-star experience shouldn't start with voicemail

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if this fits? I can also set up a free demo where you call a test number and see exactly how it works.

Best,
