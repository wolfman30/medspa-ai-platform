Hi Dr. McDaniel,

I noticed that Fairlawn Aesthetic MD encourages patients to call or text (330) 801-9069 to book — which makes sense given the personalized, clinical approach you take with every patient.

But here's something I see with practices like yours: when you're mid-treatment doing a Nova Thread lift or injecting filler, those calls go to voicemail. And research shows 62% of callers won't leave one — they just call the next clinic on Google.

I built an AI receptionist specifically for aesthetic practices. When a call goes unanswered, it instantly texts the patient back, qualifies what they need (Botox? Filler? Cryo T Shock?), and gets them scheduled — all while you're still with your current patient.

Since you're running two locations (Fairlawn and Ontario), that's twice the missed call risk.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if this could work for your practice? I can also set up a free test so you can see exactly how it handles a missed call to your number.

Best,
