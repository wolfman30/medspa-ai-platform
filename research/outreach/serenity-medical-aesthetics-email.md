Hi there,

I came across Serenity Medical Aesthetics while researching aesthetic practices in the Canton area. Your focus on injectables, lasers, and wellness in a personalized setting really stands out.

I noticed your hours are Monday through Friday, 9 to 5. That means every call that comes in on evenings and weekends — when most people are actually free to research and book treatments — goes unanswered.

Here's the thing: 62% of those callers won't leave a voicemail. They'll just Google the next med spa.

I built an AI receptionist that catches those missed calls instantly. It texts the patient back within seconds, finds out what they're looking for (Botox? Fillers? Skin care?), and moves them toward booking — even at 9 PM on a Saturday.

It's $497/month and pays for itself if it recovers even one or two filler appointments.

Would you be open to seeing how it works? I can set up a free test run with your actual phone number — takes about 10 minutes.

Best,
