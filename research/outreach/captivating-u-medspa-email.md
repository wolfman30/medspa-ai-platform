**Subject:** The downside of being the only provider your clients trust

---

Hi there,

I love CaptivatingU's approach — "one provider, every time." It builds incredible trust and loyalty. But it also means something else: when you're mid-injection, nobody's picking up the phone.

And in aesthetics, that's expensive. Studies show 62% of missed calls never try again. They don't leave a voicemail — they just Google the next med spa and book there.

We built something specifically for practices like yours. When a call goes unanswered, our AI sends the caller a personalized text within seconds. It asks what they're interested in, shows your available times, and can even collect a deposit — all while you're focused on the client in front of you.

A few reasons this could be huge for CaptivatingU:
- **Single-provider model** = every missed call is 100% lost revenue (no one else to catch it)
- **Wegovy demand is surging** — weight loss inquiries don't stop at 5 PM
- **Luxury positioning** — a fast, personal text response matches your brand better than voicemail ever could

I can set up a free demo in 10 minutes — you call a test number and see exactly what your patients would experience.

Interested?
