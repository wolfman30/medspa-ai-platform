Hey Heather! 👋 Congrats on taking ownership of Monarch in 2022 — 24-year legacy and you're modernizing it. Love that.

Quick question: with you and Megan both seeing patients, who's catching calls when you're both in procedures? Those weekend calls?

I built an AI receptionist for med spas. When a call gets missed, it texts the patient back instantly — knows your Botox, CoolSculpting, laser, fillers — and books them in. No more voicemail.

Wanna see it work? Call (440) 744-8197 — live demo. Ask about anything.
