# Outreach Email — Light Touch Aesthetic Center

**To:** Light Touch Aesthetic Center (owner/physician)
**Subject:** 25 years of Light Touch — but what happens when someone calls during a laser session?

---

Hi there,

I came across Light Touch Aesthetic Center and was impressed — 25 years serving Cleveland is incredible, and the expansion from laser hair removal into a full aesthetics practice shows real commitment to your patients.

I'm reaching out because we work with independent med spas like yours to solve a specific problem: **missed calls that become lost patients.**

When you're in the middle of a procedure — laser treatment, filler injection, consultation — and the phone rings, that caller often hangs up and books with whoever answers first. Studies show 80% of callers won't leave a voicemail.

**MedSpa Concierge** is an AI receptionist that instantly texts back anyone who calls and doesn't get an answer. It qualifies them, answers questions about your services, and can even book their appointment — all via text, 24/7.

For a practice like yours with 25 years of reputation, every missed call is a missed opportunity to serve someone who already trusts your name.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if it's a fit? I can also set up a free demo with your actual phone number so you can see it in action.

Best,
Andrew Wolf
