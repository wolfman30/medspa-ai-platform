# Instagram DM — Summit MedAesthetics

Hey Dr. Apostolis! 👋 Two locations (Akron + Boardman) plus surgical procedures — you're clearly in high demand.

But here's the thing: when you're in a procedure, calls go to voicemail. And those patients often just call the next clinic on Google.

I built an AI receptionist for med spas. Missed call → instant text back → books the appointment. It knows your Botox, Juvederm, IV therapy, weight loss — the full menu.

Wanna see it? Call (440) 744-8197 — live demo running 24/7.
