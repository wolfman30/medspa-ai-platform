Hi there,

I noticed BodyTonic offers same-day appointment booking, which is awesome for patients who can get through. But with your busiest hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays running until 7pm, plus being closed Mondays — how many calls go to voicemail from people browsing your online shop or seeing a friend's lip flip results?

We built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas like yours. When a call goes unanswered, it instantly texts the caller back, qualifies them (what service, new vs returning, timing), and can book them — all within the same text thread. No app to download, no portal to log into.

One Cleveland-area med spa we're working with recovered 3 leads in their first week that would have gone to a competitor.

Would love to show you a 2-minute demo. Can I send you a test number to try it yourself?

Best,
