Hey Dr. Gemma! 👋 Voted Top 3 Med Spa in Akron — congrats! And I love the "self-health while having fun" vibe.

I have a question: since you personally do all the procedures, what happens when someone calls during an appointment? That's probably 6-8 hours a day where calls go to voicemail.

I built an AI receptionist for med spas. When you miss a call, it texts the patient back instantly — knows your Botox, Daxxify, microneedling, ZO facials — and gets them booked.

Wanna see it work? Call (440) 744-8197 — live demo. Try asking about dermal fillers.
