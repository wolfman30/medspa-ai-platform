Hi Dr. McCarren,

I noticed Timeless Aesthetics was one of the first practices in Cincinnati to offer Secret RF — that kind of early adoption tells me you care about staying ahead of the curve.

But I have a question: when someone searches "Secret RF Cincinnati" at 7 PM on a Thursday and calls your office, what happens? If it goes to voicemail, there's a good chance they're calling the next result on Google before you even see the missed call.

We built an AI-powered text-back system for med spas. When a call goes unanswered, the caller gets a personalized text within seconds — asking what they're interested in, checking your availability, and collecting a deposit if they want to book. It works 24/7, even when your team is focused on patient care.

Why this matters for a dual-practice like yours:
- **Family medicine + aesthetics** = your front desk is already stretched thin
- **After-hours inquiries** — aesthetic patients browse and call evenings/weekends
- **Measurable ROI** — every recovered lead is a procedure you would've lost

I'd love to show you a quick demo — takes 10 minutes, and you can call a test number yourself to experience it.

Worth a conversation?
