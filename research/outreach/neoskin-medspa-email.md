# Outreach Email — NEOSkin Medical Spa

Hi Dr. Bedrick,

NEOSkin stands out as a truly premium medical spa — the membership tiers, CareCredit/PatientFi integration, and your international training all signal a practice that takes patient experience seriously.

I have a quick question: what happens when someone calls NEOSkin after hours, or when your team is busy with a client? For most med spas, those calls go to voicemail — and 85% of those callers never call back.

We built MedSpa Concierge to capture those leads instantly. When a call is missed, our AI texts the caller within seconds, qualifies them (service interest, timing, new vs returning), and starts the booking process. It runs 24/7.

For a practice with premium pricing and high-value services like CoolSculpting and advanced injectables, even one recovered lead per week could mean $1,000-2,000+ in revenue that would have otherwise gone to a competitor.

**$497/month. No setup fee for founding clients.**

I'd love to show you a 2-minute live demo. Would you be open to a quick conversation?

Best,
Andrew Wolf
