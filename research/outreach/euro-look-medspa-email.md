Hi,

Euro Look MedSpa clearly has something special — 364+ five-star reviews doesn't happen by accident. Your clients love you.

But here's a question that even the best-reviewed clinics struggle with: what happens when someone calls and you're with a client?

Most people won't leave a voicemail. They'll just call the next med spa on Google. That's a lost Botox appointment, a lost filler client — revenue that walks away silently.

We built an AI receptionist that instantly texts back anyone who calls when you can't pick up. It feels personal, asks what they're looking for, and can help them get on your schedule — all automatically.

No new phone number. No app. No staff training. Just fewer missed opportunities.

We're waiving setup fees ($1,500 value) for our first 10 founding clinics. Worth a 10-minute conversation?

Best,
