# Outreach Email — KÜR Modern Medical Aesthetics

Hi Nina,

Congratulations on building KÜR into one of Cleveland's most loved med spas — Top 100 Best Injectors and the kind of loyalty where clients say they'd "follow you to the moon." That's rare and earned.

Here's the thing: when you're creating art on someone's face (your words!), you can't answer the phone. And the person calling — maybe a referral from one of those raving fans — gets silence. Most won't leave a voicemail. Some will Google the next option.

**MedSpa Concierge** is an AI receptionist that instantly texts back anyone who calls KÜR and doesn't get through. It answers their questions, qualifies them for the right service, and helps get them on your schedule — all via text, so you never have to stop mid-injection.

For a small team like yours (you, Elizabeth, Nataleigh), every pair of hands is doing something. This gives you a virtual front desk that never takes a break.

I'd love to show you a 10-minute demo — I can even set it up with your number so you see exactly what your callers would experience.

Best,
Andrew Wolf
