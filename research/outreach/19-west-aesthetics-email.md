Hi Shannon,

Congrats on launching 19 West Aesthetics — building a solo practice in the Dayton market takes real guts, especially with your nursing background driving the clinical quality.

As a solo practitioner, you're probably juggling injections and admin at the same time. When you're mid-Botox and someone calls or DMs asking about fillers, that lead might not wait.

We built an AI receptionist for exactly this scenario — it catches missed calls and texts the patient back immediately, qualifies them (service, timing, budget), and gets them on your calendar. Think of it as a front desk that works 24/7 for a fraction of the cost of hiring someone.

We're waiving the $1,500 setup fee for our first 10 Ohio clinics. Monthly is $497 — roughly the cost of one filler appointment per month.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo? I can show you how it works with your actual practice flow.

Best,
