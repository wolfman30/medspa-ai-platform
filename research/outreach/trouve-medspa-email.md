# Trouvé MedSpa — Outreach Email

**To:** Trouvé MedSpa Team
**Subject:** Never miss another call across your two locations

---

Hi there,

I've been following Trouvé MedSpa on Instagram — your content is fantastic (1,100+ posts!), and it's clear you've built something special with two locations and a training academy. The "True to You" philosophy really resonates.

Here's the challenge I see with growing multi-location practices: when your Mayfield Heights team is busy and a new client calls, that lead might try Beachwood — or worse, a competitor. With multiple providers across two locations, coordinating phone coverage is a constant headache.

MedSpa Concierge is an AI text-back service that instantly responds to every missed call at both locations. It qualifies new patients, answers questions about your 12+ service categories, and helps them take the next step — all automatically, 24/7.

For a practice your size, even recovering 5-10 missed-call leads per month at your average treatment value would easily pay for the service many times over.

Would your team be open to a quick 10-minute demo? Our founding clients get the first month free with no setup fees.

Best,
