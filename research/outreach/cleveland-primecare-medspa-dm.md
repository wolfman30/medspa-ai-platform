Hey! 👋 Love the "wellness from the inside out" approach — combining primary care with aesthetics is super smart.

Quick thought: with your team juggling both sides of the practice, I bet the phones get crazy. I built an AI receptionist that catches missed calls and instantly texts patients back with your actual services + books them.

It already handles Botox, fillers, PRP — the whole menu. Wanna see a live demo? Call (440) 744-8197 and try to "miss" a call. It's pretty cool.
