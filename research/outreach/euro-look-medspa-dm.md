Hey! 👋 364+ five-star reviews — that's insane. You're clearly doing something right in Cleveland.

Quick question though: with that kind of volume, how many calls do you think slip through when your team's busy with clients?

I built an AI receptionist for med spas. It catches missed calls and instantly texts the patient back — knows your full menu (Botox, fillers, RF microneedling, all of it) and books them in. No hold music, no voicemail black hole.

Wanna see it work? Call (440) 744-8197 — that's a live demo. Ask it about lip filler.
