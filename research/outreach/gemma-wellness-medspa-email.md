Hi Dr. Gemma,

Congrats on the Top #3 Med Spa recognition in Akron — clearly your patients love the personal touch. The fact that you do every procedure yourself says a lot about the quality you deliver.

But here's the flip side of that dedication: when you're with a patient (which is most of the day), your phone goes unanswered. And studies show 85% of callers who reach voicemail won't call back — they just Google the next option.

We built MedSpa Concierge to solve exactly this. When a call goes unanswered, our AI instantly texts the caller back, qualifies them (what service they want, new vs returning, timing preferences), and starts the booking process. It runs 24/7, so even after-hours inquiries get an immediate response.

For a solo practice like yours where YOU are the brand, every missed call is a missed connection with someone who specifically chose you. Our system makes sure they don't slip away.

**$497/month. No setup fee for founding clients.** And I'm happy to set up a live demo — just text our test number and see the AI in action. Takes 2 minutes.

Would love to show you how it works. Open to a quick call?

Best,
Andrew Wolf
