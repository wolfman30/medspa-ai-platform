# Outreach Email — Confidence Med Spa

**To:** (via Instagram DM or website contact — "Text to book" model)
**Subject:** You already text with clients — what if AI handled the first message?

Hi Victoria,

I saw that Confidence Med Spa uses "text to book" right on your Instagram bio — smart move. Clients clearly prefer texting over calling. But you've been doing this since 2014 and I imagine the volume has grown. When you're in session Tuesday night at 8pm, who's answering those texts?

We built an AI that does exactly what you'd do — responds instantly to missed calls and texts, qualifies the lead (service interest, new vs returning, availability), and guides them toward booking. It sounds like you, references your actual services, and works 24/7.

Since you're already text-first, this would slot in seamlessly. Think of it as a version of you that never sleeps and never misses a message.

Your training program tells me you're someone who stays on the cutting edge. This is the cutting edge of client acquisition.

2-minute demo — want me to send you a test number?

Best,
