Hi Kristina,

I came across Matrix MedSpa while researching top-rated aesthetics practices in Cleveland — congratulations on earning that #1 ranking. Your before-and-after gallery is impressive, and it's clear your clients trust you.

Here's something I've noticed with solo-provider practices like yours: when you're mid-treatment with a Vivace session or injecting filler, every call that goes to voicemail is a potential client who books with someone else. Studies show 80% of callers won't leave a voicemail — they just move on.

We built MedSpa Concierge specifically for practices like Matrix. It instantly texts back anyone who calls when you can't answer — no missed leads, no extra staff needed. It works 24/7, even when you're focused on the client in front of you.

Would it be worth a quick 10-minute call to see if this could help? Our founding clients get the first month free with no setup fee.

Best,
