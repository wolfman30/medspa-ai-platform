Hi Heather,

Congrats on 24 years with Monarch Aesthetic Medicine — and on taking ownership in 2022. Building on a legacy practice while making it your own is no small feat. Your reviews speak for themselves (100% recommend on Yelp!).

I wanted to flag something I see with established practices like yours: when you and Megan are both with patients — doing filler, Coolsculpting, laser treatments — incoming calls go unanswered. Industry data shows 62% of those callers won't leave a voicemail. They just move on to the next result on Google.

For a practice with your reputation, that's not just a lost appointment — it's a lost lifetime patient.

I built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas. When a call goes unanswered at (614) 545-2002, it instantly texts the caller back, qualifies what they need, and moves them toward booking. It works evenings and weekends too — when your office is closed but potential patients are browsing.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call? I can also set up a free test so you can see exactly how it handles a missed call. No commitment, just a demo.

Best,
Andrew Wolf
