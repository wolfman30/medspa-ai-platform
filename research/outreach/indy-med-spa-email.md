# Indy Med Spa — Outreach Email

Hi Seana,

I found The Indy while looking into Cleveland's boutique aesthetics scene — your longevity-focused approach really stands out. Combining injectables with hormone optimization, peptide therapy, and NAD+ infusions is exactly where premium wellness is heading.

With that breadth of services, I imagine your consults run longer than a typical Botox appointment — which means more time when calls go unanswered. And with a contact-form-first website, some prospects might not take that extra step when they're comparing options.

MedSpa Concierge is an AI-powered text-back service that instantly responds to missed calls with a personalized text. It qualifies the lead, answers basic questions about your services, and can even help them book — all while you're with a client.

For a boutique practice in downtown Cleveland where every lead counts, this kind of instant response can be the difference between a new lifetime client and a lost opportunity.

I'd love to show you how it works — takes about 10 minutes. Our first 10 founding clients get waived setup fees.

Best,
