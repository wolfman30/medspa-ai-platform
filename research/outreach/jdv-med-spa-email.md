Hi Dr. Franz,

Congratulations on being #1 in Galderma sales across 90+ facilities in the Akron/Canton area — and top 500 nationally. That's a serious achievement, especially sustaining it since 2011.

But here's the flip side of being that busy: when your all-RN team is with patients doing Botox, Sculptra, or Restylane treatments across two locations, who's catching the calls?

We work with med spas across Ohio to solve exactly this. MedSpa Concierge is an AI text-back system that instantly responds to missed calls — qualifying the patient, answering basic questions, and helping them book. All automatically, 24/7.

For a practice doing your volume, even recovering 2-3 missed calls per week could mean an extra $2,000-$5,000/month in revenue from patients who would have gone elsewhere.

No contracts, no hardware, no disruption to your current workflow. Would a quick 10-minute demo be worth your time?

Best,
Andrew Wolf

**Personalization notes**: Led with their #1 Galderma achievement — shows we did our homework. Referenced their all-RN staff model and specific products. The revenue recovery angle is especially compelling for a high-volume practice. Two locations = double the missed call risk.
