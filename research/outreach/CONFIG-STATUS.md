## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Configured + demo-ready (pending Telnyx) | 2 |
| Not configured — Moxie (high priority) | 0 |
| Not configured — Other EMR | 15 |
| Not configurable (needs research) | 2 |
| **Total leads** | **19** |

### Key Takeaway
Both Moxie clinics (Adela, Lucy's) are already configured — great! The remaining 15 unconfigured prospects all use non-Moxie or unknown EMRs, so they'd get the **text-back + manual handoff** tier. Top priorities for config based on fit: Light Touch, JDV Med Spa, Confidence Med Spa, and Monarch Aesthetic Medicine.
