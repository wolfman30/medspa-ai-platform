Hi Karen,

I came across Visage MedSpa and really liked your "look better, not different" philosophy — it's clear you take a thoughtful, personalized approach with every patient.

Here's something I've heard from solo practitioners like you: when you're in a consultation or mid-injection, the phone rings. You can't answer. The caller Googles the next med spa on the list. That lead is gone in under 60 seconds.

We built MedSpa Concierge specifically for this. When a call goes unanswered, our AI texts the caller back instantly — within seconds — qualifies them (what service, new vs returning, timing), and gets them started on booking. It works 24/7, even when you're closed.

You're open 4 days a week with limited hours. That means there are a LOT of hours where calls go unanswered. Every one of those is potential revenue walking to a competitor.

**The math:** If you're missing even 3-4 calls per week, and just one converts to a filler appointment ($600-800), that's $2,400-3,200/month in recovered revenue. The service is $497/month.

I'd love to set up a quick demo — you can text a test number and see exactly how it works. Takes 2 minutes.

Would you be open to a quick call this week?

Best,
