Hi Julia,

Fellow Akron native here (well, our team is based in Northeast Ohio). I saw that you built Modern Vitality from the ground up — NP-owned, transparent pricing, deep local roots. That's impressive.

Here's what I keep hearing from solo NP practice owners: when you're with a patient, you can't answer the phone. And by the time you call back, that person already booked with someone else on Google.

We built an AI text-back system for exactly this. When a call goes unanswered, it instantly texts the caller, asks what service they're interested in (Botox, BBL, fillers — whatever you offer), qualifies them, and helps them book. All via text, no apps.

You're closed weekends and your pricing is already on the website — so people are researching you on Saturday and calling Monday. What if those Saturday callers got an instant text instead of voicemail?

I'd love to show you how it works. Takes 2 minutes. Can I send you a test number to try?

Best,
