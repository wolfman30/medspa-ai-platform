Hi Molly,

I came across Define You Medical Spa and love what you've built — the personalized approach, the great reviews, the attention to detail. It's clear your clients trust you.

But here's a question: when you're mid-microneedling session and the phone rings, what happens to that call?

If it goes to voicemail, there's a good chance that person is already Googling the next med spa in Canton. Studies show 80% of missed callers don't leave a message — they just move on.

We built an AI text-back system that instantly responds to missed calls with a personalized text. It asks what service they're interested in, qualifies them, and can even help schedule — all while you're focused on the client in your chair.

No app. No new phone number. Works with what you already have.

We're waiving our $1,500 setup fee for our first 10 founding clinics. Would a quick 10-minute call make sense?

Best,
