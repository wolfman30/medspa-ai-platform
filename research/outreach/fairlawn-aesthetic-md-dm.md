# Instagram DM — Fairlawn Aesthetic MD

Hey! 👋 Two locations (Fairlawn + Ontario) — that's impressive growth. But I bet managing phones across both is a headache.

I built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas. When a call gets missed at either location, it instantly texts the patient back with your services — Botox, Dysport, Nova Threads, Cryo T Shock — and gets them booked.

The cool part: it works after hours too. So those weekend calls don't just go to voicemail anymore.

Wanna see it? Call (440) 744-8197 — that's a live demo for a med spa. Ask about anything.
