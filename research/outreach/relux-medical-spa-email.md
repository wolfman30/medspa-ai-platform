Hi there,

I noticed ReLux Medical Spa closes at 5 PM on Thursdays and Fridays, and you're only open every other Saturday. That's a lot of hours where potential clients might be calling and getting voicemail.

Here's the thing — when someone calls a med spa and doesn't get an answer, 80% of them call the next place on Google instead of leaving a message.

We built something specifically for clinics like yours: an AI receptionist that instantly texts back anyone who calls when you can't answer. No app to install, no staff to train. It works with your existing phone number.

The text feels personal — it greets them, asks what they're interested in (Botox, filler, Sculptra — whatever you offer), and can even help them pick a time. All while you're with a client or closed for the day.

We're offering our first 10 founding clinics a waived setup fee ($1,500 value). Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if it's a fit?

Best,
