Hey! 👋 25 years in Cleveland — that's legendary. You were doing laser hair removal before it was trendy.

Quick thought: your phone number is on every page of your site (love that), which means you get a TON of calls. But during procedures, who's catching them?

I built an AI receptionist for med spas. Missed call → instant text to the patient → books the appointment. Knows your laser treatments, Botox, fillers, body contouring — everything.

Wanna see it work? Call (440) 744-8197 — that's a live demo. Ask about laser hair removal.
