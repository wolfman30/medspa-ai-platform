# Outreach Email — Summit MedAesthetics

**To**: Dr. Costas Apostolis / Office Manager
**Subject**: When you're with a patient in Akron, who's answering your phone?

Hi Dr. Apostolis,

I came across Summit MedAesthetics while researching top aesthetic practices in the Akron area. With your range of services — from injectables to IV therapy to surgical consultations — I imagine your team stays busy.

Here's something we've seen across med spas like yours: when you're in a consultation or procedure, missed calls silently become missed revenue. The patient who called about Botox or Kybella doesn't leave a voicemail — they just Google the next clinic.

We built MedSpa Concierge specifically for practices like Summit MedAesthetics. It's an AI-powered text-back system that instantly responds to missed calls with a personalized text message, qualifies the patient, and can even help them book — all while you're focused on the patient in front of you.

No app to install. No staff training. It just works alongside your existing phone number.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if it's a fit? I can also set up a free demo on your actual phone line so you can see it in action.

Best,
Andrew Wolf

**Personalization notes**: Referenced their specific services (injectables, IV therapy, surgical consultations) and the busy nature of a two-location practice. The "consultation or procedure" angle is especially relevant since Dr. Apostolis does surgical work — he's definitely unavailable for long stretches.
