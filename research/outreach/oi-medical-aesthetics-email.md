**Subject:** Quick question about your call-to-schedule model

Hi Dr. Hilty,

I noticed OI Medical Aesthetics operates on an appointment-only, call-to-schedule basis — which makes a lot of sense for a practice your size with 6 providers to coordinate.

But I'm curious: what happens when someone calls during a consultation or after hours? With Botox at $12.50/unit and fillers at $750/syringe, even one missed call could mean $500+ walking out the door — probably to a competitor who texts back faster.

We built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas like yours. When a call goes unanswered, it instantly texts the patient back, qualifies them (service, provider preference, timing), and books them — all within a few texts. No app to download, no portal to learn.

One of our Ohio clinics recovered 3 leads in the first week that would've been lost.

Would it be worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits your practice? I can show you exactly how it works with a live demo using your own phone number.

Best,
