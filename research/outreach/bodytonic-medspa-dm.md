Hey! 👋 I saw you guys offer same-day appointments — that's awesome. Quick question: what happens when someone calls on a Monday (when you're closed) wanting to book?

I built an AI receptionist specifically for med spas. When a call gets missed, it instantly texts the patient back with your real services and books them in. It already knows your Glo2Facial, VirtueRF, everything.

Wanna see it work? Call (440) 744-8197 — that's a live demo running for another med spa. Watch what happens when you "miss" the call. Pretty wild.
