# Outreach Email — Cleveland Primecare MedSpa

**To:** Deidra Bobincheck, NP-C
**Subject:** Primary care + medspa = twice the phone traffic. Are you catching it all?

Hi Deidra,

I noticed Cleveland Primecare MedSpa offers something unique — combining primary care, mental health, and aesthetics under one roof in Beachwood. That "wellness from the inside out" approach clearly resonates with patients.

But it also means your phone is ringing for three different reasons. And when you're with a BOTOX patient or in a primary care visit, those medspa inquiries are going to voicemail — or worse, to a competitor.

**MedSpa Concierge** by AI Wolf Solutions is an AI receptionist that instantly texts back anyone who calls and doesn't reach you. It qualifies the lead, answers questions about your services (BOTOX, Xeomin, fillers, PRP), and can help schedule them — all automatically.

It's like hiring a dedicated receptionist for your medspa side, without the overhead.

Would 10 minutes for a quick demo be worth your time? I can show you exactly how it works with your phone number.

Best,
Andrew Wolf
