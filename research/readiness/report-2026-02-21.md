# Readiness Report — 2026-02-21

## Readiness Score: 85/100 (↑ from 82 yesterday)

### Why the increase
- **23 commits in ~36h** — massive velocity continues
- Voice AI webhook handler landed (Telnyx integration) — Phase II groundwork
- LLM upgraded from Claude Haiku 4.5 → Sonnet 4.6 (better qualification quality)
- After-hours greeting fix for appointment-only clinics
- Mobile-responsive portal fix
- Date-based slot selection ("Feb 28", "the 28th") now works
- Flexible schedule replies ("whenever works") recognized
- Complete outreach scripts for all 21 prospects
- CEO Dashboard additions: Testing Status card, Rule of 100 tracker
- E2E smoke test timeout doubled (45s → 90s) for CI stability

## What Was Accomplished (Feb 20-21)
- **Voice AI webhook** — `POST /webhooks/telnyx-voice` with AssistantID validation (`f3dfecc`, `98be220`)
- **LLM upgrade** — Sonnet 4.6 replaces Haiku 4.5 for conversation quality (`e39adc9`)
- **After-hours greeting fixed** — appointment-only clinics handled correctly (`a0c16f6`, `5f2593c`)
- **Mobile portal** — nav stacks, tables fit screen (`ef4d6a6`)
- **Date-based slot selection** — "Feb 28", "2/28", "the 28th" all work (`c9c784d`)
- **Flexible schedule parsing** — "whenever works" recognized (`10a6b89`)
- **21 outreach scripts complete** — texts, DMs, full playbook (`8fb5238`)
- **CEO Dashboard** — Testing Status card + Rule of 100 tracker (`4bd8909`, `1de212c`)
- **Docs consolidated** — SPEC + ARCHITECTURE model (`ef33476`, `f18dc5b`)
- **Evidence upload auth fixed** — uses Cognito instead of admin_jwt (`42a6f75`)
- **3 new prospects researched** — Fairlawn Aesthetic MD, Serenity Medical, Monarch Aesthetic (total: 21)

## Current Blockers

### Hard Blockers
1. **No real operator has tested** — Still only Andrew. This is THE blocker.
2. **Website not updated** — No pricing, no Calendly, outdated "after-hours" copy
3. **E2E suite needs re-run** — 23+ commits since last validated run

### Soft Blockers
- Ack messages still doubling SMS costs
- Onboarding (J1-J8) entirely untested
- 10DLC for new clinic numbers (only Forever 22 active)

## Pre-Operator Checklist: 64/102 (63%)
No change in tested scenario count. Work focused on quality/features, not checklist coverage.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (This Weekend)
1. **Re-run full E2E** — 23 commits untested. Could be at 28+/30 given all the fixes.
2. **Andrew: TEXT Brandi** — "Hey, can you test something for me this week?" One text. 30 seconds.

### Next Week (Feb 23-27)
1. **Operator testing** — THE priority. Everything else is secondary.
2. **Website fixes** — Remove "after-hours", add pricing ($497/mo), add Calendly. 2-3 hours of work.
3. **Send 3 outreach emails** — Monarch (strongest), Fairlawn (two locations), and one follow-up.

### Strategic Notes
- **Voice AI webhook is a signal** — Phase II infrastructure is being laid before Phase I is fully validated. This is fine as long as it doesn't distract from operator testing.
- **Sonnet 4.6 upgrade** is a quality multiplier — should reduce the 4 E2E failures from LLM recognition issues.
- **21 prospects with full outreach scripts** but almost none sent. The sales bottleneck is execution, not preparation.
- **Rule of 100 tracker** is a smart accountability tool — forces daily sales activity measurement.
- **The gap is closing** — technically the product is demo-ready. The blockers are all human action items (Brandi testing, website updates, outreach sends).

## Distance to First Sale: 2-3 weeks
Unchanged. Technical readiness improved but human bottlenecks (operator testing, outreach execution) remain the constraint.
