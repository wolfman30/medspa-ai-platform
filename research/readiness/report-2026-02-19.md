# Readiness Report — 2026-02-19

## Readiness Score: 78/100 (↑ from ~72 yesterday)

## What Was Accomplished (Feb 18)
- **5 E2E failures addressed** (commit `07a84a2`) — service vocab, post-procedure guard, multi-turn ordering
- **System prompt updated** to recognize "11s", "lip flip", "frown lines" as Botox (`30c57dd`)
- **Post-procedure output guard broadened** (`669678d`)
- **Prospect tracker** — full Postgres CRUD + admin dashboard (`860fb8c`)
- **CEO Dashboard** added as default admin tab (`b0c130c`)
- **Auto-migration on startup** — no manual DB migration step (`bcf04d4`)
- **Structured event logger** for conversation debugging (`27b0eaf`)
- **3 new sales prospects researched** (Euro Look, ReLux, Define You) — ReLux is outreach-ready
- **Repo made public** + BSL 1.1 license applied

## Current Blockers

### Hard Blockers
1. **E2E re-validation needed** — 4 failures were fixed in code but not re-verified against live dev
2. **No real operator has tested yet** — Only Andrew has used the system
3. **Website not updated** — 9 issues identified, no pricing page, no Calendly link

### Soft Blockers
- Ack messages still doubling SMS costs
- Onboarding flow (J1-J8) entirely untested
- Admin portal settings/multi-org untested (G4-G10)

## What's Next (Priority Order)
1. **Run E2E suite** to confirm fixes → target 30/30 passing
2. **Website fixes** — pricing page, Calendly, updated copy (removes "after-hours" language)
3. **Operator testing** — Get Brandi/Gale at Forever 22 to test real flow
4. **ReLux outreach** — Andrew to approve email, send
5. **Follow up** on Forever 22 and Brilliant Aesthetics by Feb 21

## Strategic Recommendations

### Short-term (This Week)
- **Validate fixes first.** Don't pitch new clinics until E2E is clean. One bad demo kills trust.
- **Website is the #2 priority** after E2E. Prospects will Google "AI Wolf Solutions" — site must convert.
- **ReLux Medical Spa** is the strongest new prospect: phone-dependent, limited hours, independent. Perfect ICP match.

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
- **Operator testing is the unlock.** Everything else is prep. Brandi/Gale testing the real flow validates the product for sales.
- **Pipeline is healthy at 7 prospects** — don't over-invest in outreach until operator testing confirms readiness.
- **CEO Dashboard + prospect tracker** are great for Andrew's visibility — use these in demos.

### Strategic Note
The Feb 18 burst of commits was productive — 15 commits touching core fixes, infrastructure, and sales tooling. The codebase is maturing. The gap is now operational (testing, website, outreach) not technical. Shift energy from building to validating and selling.
