# Readiness Report — 2026-02-22

## Readiness Score: 86/100 (↑ from 85 yesterday)

### Why the increase (+1)
- 20+ commits since last report — continued high velocity
- **worker.go refactored** into focused files by concern (maintainability win)
- **ProcessMessage helper extraction** — LLM service down from 3,250→2,401 lines
- **Service pricing auto-populated** from Moxie sync (no manual config)
- **Price inquiry handler** now resolves service aliases correctly
- **Day abbreviation extraction fixed** (Mon/Tues/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun)
- **Filler variant resolution loop fixed** — no more broken clarification questions
- **Duplicate message upsert fix** — prevents key failures in smoke tests
- **GitHub workflow_run webhook** with signature verification + Telegram alerts
- **Smoke test resilience** — removed day preference constraint, relaxed Botox/Tox matching
- Score capped at +1 because no new human-action blockers were cleared

### What Was Accomplished (Feb 21-22)
- **Code quality**: worker.go split, ProcessMessage refactored, pure function tests added
- **Bug fixes**: variant resolution loop, ON CONFLICT syntax, service alias in price inquiry, day abbreviation parsing, duplicate messages
- **Infrastructure**: Bedrock model ID corrected for Sonnet 4.6, browser sidecar disabled in CI
- **DevOps**: GitHub workflow webhook with Telegram alerts for deploy status
- **Testing**: Smoke test hardened (relaxed assertions, upsert fix)

## Current Blockers

### Hard Blockers (unchanged)
1. **No real operator has tested** — THE blocker. Brandi/Gale have never touched it.
2. **Website not updated** — No pricing, no Calendly, "after-hours" copy still wrong
3. **E2E can't run from sandbox** — ADMIN_JWT_SECRET not available to cron agents

### Soft Blockers
- Ack messages still doubling SMS costs
- Onboarding (J1-J8) entirely untested
- 10DLC for new clinic numbers (only Forever 22 active)

## Pre-Operator Checklist: 64/102 (63%)
No change in tested count — work focused on refactoring and bug fixes, not new test coverage.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Critical (Today/Tomorrow)
1. **Andrew: Text Brandi** — This is day 3+ of recommending this. One 30-second text unlocks everything.
2. **E2E environment fix** — Either expose ADMIN_JWT_SECRET to sandbox or run `make e2e-dev` manually. 20+ commits are untested.

### This Week (Feb 23-27)
1. **Operator testing with Brandi** — #1 priority bar none
2. **Website update** — Remove "after-hours", add $497/mo pricing, add Calendly link. Half a day.
3. **Send 3 outreach messages** — Monarch, Fairlawn, one follow-up. Scripts are ready.

### Strategic Notes
- **Excellent refactoring velocity** — the codebase is getting cleaner (worker split, LLM service extraction). This pays dividends when onboarding new clinics.
- **Price auto-population from Moxie sync** is a quality-of-life win for onboarding — less manual config per clinic.
- **The pattern is clear**: technical work is moving fast, human bottlenecks (Brandi testing, website, outreach) are static. The product is ready for testing NOW.
- **It's Sunday** — good day for Andrew to text Brandi casually ("Hey, got something cool to show you this week").

## Score Breakdown
| Area | Score | Max | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Core booking flow | 23 | 25 | Bug fixes likely improved; can't verify (E2E blocked) |
| Payment integration | 9 | 10 | Price inquiry + alias resolution fixed |
| Admin portal | 7 | 10 | Unchanged |
| Sales readiness | 6 | 10 | Scripts ready, nothing sent |
| Compliance/security | 9 | 10 | GitHub webhook signature verification added |
| Operator validation | 2 | 10 | Still zero non-Andrew testing |
| Infrastructure | 9 | 10 | Bedrock model ID fixed, CI hardened |
| Documentation | 8 | 10 | Unchanged |
| Onboarding | 3 | 5 | Price auto-populate helps but J-tests still untested |
| Code quality | 10 | — | Bonus: significant refactoring (worker, LLM service) |
| **Total** | **86** | **100** | |

## Distance to First Sale: 2-3 weeks
Unchanged. Technical distance is shrinking daily. Human action items remain the constraint.
