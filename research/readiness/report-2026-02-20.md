# Readiness Report — 2026-02-20

## Readiness Score: 82/100 (↑ from 78 yesterday)

### Why the increase
- 14 commits landed in 24h — heavy focus on booking quality (provider filtering, timezone handling, time preferences)
- Moxie checklist UX improved (email moved post-time-selection)
- Duplicate progress SMS eliminated
- Prospect detail view now has outreach drafts + research inline
- Pipeline expanded to 10+ prospects with 3 new outreach-ready

## What Was Accomplished (Feb 19)
- **Provider preference filtering** — `ResolveProviderID()` maps name→Moxie ID, filters availability (`3e80214`, `b8be352`, `c59a7d3`)
- **Centralized timezone handling** — `timezone.go` with `ParseSlotTime()`, `ClinicLocation()`, `FormatAppointmentConfirmation()` (`147a4ff`)
- **Time range extraction fixed** — "5-6pm", "tue-thu" now parse correctly (`dbbcc8f`, `9ebe104`)
- **Moxie checklist reordered** — email collected after time selection, not before (`c57e3f4`)
- **Duplicate progress SMS eliminated** (`dab6c62`)
- **Time-aware greeting** — system adjusts greeting based on time of day (`9ebe104`)
- **Prospect detail view enhanced** — outreach drafts, research, timeline all inline (`4ab4f7c`, `c8ad58f`)
- **3 new prospects researched** — BodyTonic, Modern Vitality, Confidence Med-Spa (all Ohio, outreach-ready)
- **Conversation status tracking** — auto-updates to 'booked' after appointment creation (`5c71f43`)

## Current Blockers

### Hard Blockers
1. **E2E suite not re-run** — 14 commits since last run, need validation
2. **No real operator has tested** — Still only Andrew
3. **Website not updated** — No pricing, no Calendly, outdated copy

### Soft Blockers
- Ack messages still doubling SMS costs
- Onboarding (J1-J8) entirely untested
- Admin portal settings/multi-org (G4-G10) untested

## Pre-Operator Checklist: 64/102 (63%)
No change in tested count — all work was quality improvements to existing flows, not new scenario coverage.

## Strategic Recommendations

### This Week (Feb 20-21)
1. **Run full E2E suite** — Validate 14 commits haven't regressed anything. Target 28+/30.
2. **Andrew: send 3 outreach emails** (BodyTonic, Modern Vitality, Confidence) — pipeline is stalling without sends.
3. **Website quick fixes** — At minimum: remove "after-hours" language, add $497/mo pricing.

### Next Week (Feb 23-28)
1. **Operator testing with Brandi/Gale** — The single most important milestone. Everything else is secondary.
2. **Calendly link** for inbound demo scheduling — low effort, high leverage for outreach emails.
3. **Start testing J-category** (onboarding) scenarios — manual is fine for first 10 clients, but self-serve is the scalability lever.

### Strategic Notes
- **Velocity is excellent** — 14 quality commits/day shows the platform is maturing fast.
- **Biggest risk is NOT technical** — it's that no one outside Andrew has used the product. Operator testing breaks the feedback loop open.
- **Pipeline is growing** (10+ prospects) but no outreach has been sent to the 3 newest. Sales motion needs Andrew's 15 minutes/day.
- **Provider preference filtering** is a differentiator — most competitors don't let patients request specific providers during AI booking. Worth highlighting in sales materials.

## Distance to First Sale: 2-3 weeks
Shortened from 2-4 weeks. Technical readiness is accelerating. The bottleneck is human testing + sales outreach execution.
