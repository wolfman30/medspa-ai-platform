# Ops Report — 2026-02-20 (09:00 UTC)

## Status: ✅ All Green

### Dev API
- `GET /ready` → **200 OK**

### GitHub CI
- `gh` CLI not found at expected path (`~/.local/bin/gh`). Needs reinstall.
- Last commit: `71f91f1` — fix: atomic dedupe for duplicate Telnyx webhooks

### Workspace
- **4 uncommitted changes** (3,666 lines deleted):
  - `M internal/api/router/router.go` (6 lines removed)
  - `D internal/conversation/phone_simulator.go` (731 lines)
  - `D internal/conversation/phone_simulator_enhanced.go` (1,202 lines)
  - `D internal/demo/mock_booking.go` (1,727 lines)
- These look like intentional cleanup (removing phone simulator + mock booking code). Should be committed and pushed.

### Actions Needed
1. **Commit cleanup deletions** — looks intentional but needs Andrew's confirmation before pushing
2. **Reinstall `gh` CLI** — binary missing from `~/.local/bin/`
