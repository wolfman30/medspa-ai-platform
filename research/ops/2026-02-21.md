# Ops Report — 2026-02-21

## 13:00 UTC — Deploy & Ops Health Check

### CI Status
- **3 consecutive failures on main** (`f85e8ff`, `bbd0447`, PR `feature/instagram-dm-adapter`)
- Root cause: `TestResolvedBookingAdapter` — vagaro/boulevard platform tests added in `f85e8ff` but `ResolvedBookingAdapter()` only checked `BookingAdapter` field and Moxie specifically, not generic `BookingPlatform` fallback
- Deploy pipeline skipped (CI gate working correctly)

### Fix Applied
- Commit `71ee782`: `ResolvedBookingAdapter` now falls through to `BookingPlatform` for any platform (vagaro, boulevard, etc.) before defaulting to "manual"
- Pushed to main, awaiting CI confirmation

### Dev API
- ✅ `api-dev.aiwolfsolutions.com/ready` → 200 OK

### Workspace
- ✅ Clean (no uncommitted changes before fix)

### Action Items
- Monitor CI run for `71ee782` to confirm green
