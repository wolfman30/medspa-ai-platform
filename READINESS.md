# MedSpa Concierge — Readiness Tracker

Last updated: 2026-02-19

## Automated E2E Test Results (Live Dev API)

**30 scenarios | 26 ✅ passing | 4 ❌ failing | 101/106 checks passed (95%)**

### Recent Fixes (Feb 18):
- `07a84a2` fix: address 5 E2E test failures
- `669678d` fix: broaden post-procedure output guard + E2E check
- `30c57dd` fix: teach system prompt that '11s', 'lip flip', 'frown lines' = Botox (no area question)
- `860fb8c` feat: prospect tracker — Postgres-backed CRUD
- `bcf04d4` feat: auto-migrate database on app startup
- `b0c130c` feat: CEO Dashboard as default admin tab

### Remaining Issues (to verify):
1. Re-run E2E to confirm 4 previous failures are resolved by commits above
2. Post-procedure guard broadened — needs validation
3. Service vocabulary ("11s", "lip flip") — prompt fix deployed, needs E2E confirmation

## Pre-Operator Testing Checklist (SPEC.md §3b)

**Total: 102 scenarios | ✅ 64 passing | ❌ 0 failing | 🔲 38 untested**
**Completion: 63%**

### By Category

| Category | Total | ✅ | 🔲 | Notes |
|----------|-------|----|----|-------|
| A. Lead Engagement | 6 | 3 | 3 | A1 (missed call→SMS), A3/A4 (hours-based greeting) untested |
| B. AI Qualification | 16 | 16 | 0 | **COMPLETE** ✅ |
| C. Availability & Booking | 10 | 8 | 2 | C7 (no slots), C9 (unconfigured service) |
| D. Payment & Deposit | 11 | 6 | 5 | D5 (mobile), D10 (expiry), D11 (abandon) |
| E. Conversation Quality | 15 | 12 | 3 | E10 (tone), E14 (non-English), E15 (long msgs) |
| F. Compliance & Security | 5 | 4 | 1 | F5 (rate limiting) |
| G. Admin Portal | 10 | 3 | 7 | G4-G10 (settings, knowledge, multi-org) |
| H. Edge Cases | 10 | 8 | 2 | Mostly covered |
| I. Stress & Race Conditions | 7 | 4 | 3 | I6 (simultaneous booking), I7 (cancel mid-flow) |
| J. Onboarding | 8 | 0 | 8 | **ALL UNTESTED** — onboarding flow not ready |

### Hard Blockers for Operator Testing

1. **A1 (Missed Call → SMS)** — Core feature never tested end-to-end with real phone by a non-Andrew user.
2. **Multi-clinic `from` number wiring** — Must verify correct per-clinic Telnyx number used for outbound SMS.
3. **5 E2E test failures** — LLM-level issues with service vocabulary recognition and response quality.

### 10DLC Status
- **AI Wolf Solutions brand**: Already registered on Telnyx ✅
- **Forever 22 number (+14407448197)**: Registered under AI Wolf campaign, SMS delivery working ✅
- **Brilliant Aesthetics number (+13305932634)**: NOT registered under campaign → SMS blocked
- **New clinic numbers**: Must be added to AI Wolf campaign before SMS works

### Soft Blockers (Should fix, not deal-breakers)

1. **J1-J8 Onboarding** — Clinic can be manually configured, but no self-serve flow yet.
2. **G5-G10 Portal features** — Admin portal works for conversations/knowledge; settings and multi-org untested.
3. **D10/D11 Payment edge cases** — Stripe handles most gracefully by default.

## Readiness: Forever 22 Operator Testing

**Can Brandi/Gale test today? ALMOST — 95% ready**

### What works ✅
- Full booking flow: missed call → AI qualification → Moxie availability → Stripe Checkout → Moxie booking
- All 46 services configured with aliases
- Both providers (Brandi Sesock, Gale Tesar) configured
- Service variants (weight loss in-person/virtual) — now with LLM-powered classification
- Booking policies (deposit, age, terms) shown pre-payment
- Prompt injection defense (3-layer)
- TCPA compliance (STOP/HELP/START)
- Admin portal: conversations, knowledge editor, Moxie sync
- **10DLC registered & SMS delivery confirmed** on +14407448197
- 26/30 E2E scenarios passing (101/106 checks)

### What's blocking ❌
1. **4 E2E failures** — LLM sometimes doesn't recognize "fix my 11s" or "lip flip" as Botox/lip filler
2. **Ack messages still double SMS costs** — Root cause known (`internal/messaging/ack.go`), not fixed
3. **Not tested by a real med spa operator yet** — Only Andrew has tested

### What would make it better (not blocking)
- After-hours greeting logic untested (A3/A4)
- Non-English message handling untested (E14)
- Onboarding is manual (no self-serve)

## Readiness: First Sale

**Can we sell today? CLOSE — demo-ready, marketing not**

### Sales Readiness Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Working product demo | ✅ | 440 number works, SMS delivering |
| 10DLC registered | ✅ | AI Wolf Solutions brand, Forever 22 number active |
| Website updated | ❌ | 9 issues identified, not fixed |
| Pricing page | ❌ | $497/mo not on website |
| Calendly/booking link | ❌ | No way for leads to schedule demo |
| Sales outreach content | ⚠️ Draft | Outreach email drafted, not sent |
| Stripe Connect working | ✅ | Test mode verified |
| Multiple clinics configured | ⚠️ | Forever 22 ✅, Brilliant ⚠️ (SMS issue), Lucy/Adela TODO |
| Operator successfully tested | ❌ | Blocked by above |

### Distance to First Sale

**Estimated: 2-4 weeks**

1. **This week**: Fix 4 E2E failures, fix website, remove ack messages
2. **Week 1-2**: Operator testing with Brandi/Gale at Forever 22
3. **Week 2-3**: Iterate on feedback, fix issues
4. **Week 3-4**: Close deal or expand outreach

### Critical Path (shortest path to first sale)
1. Fix remaining 4 E2E test failures (1-2 days)
2. Fix website + add pricing + Calendly (2-3 days)
3. Remove ack messages (1 day)
4. Brandi tests → iterate → close
